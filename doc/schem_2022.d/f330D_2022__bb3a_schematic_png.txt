Schematic needs to be redrawn.

CP2104 Friend (not PiUART) used in example real circuit.

RXD on the CP2104 Friend goes to Pin 20 of the C8051F330D PDIP-20 chip.

That should be TX (P0.4 or P0.5 but definitely Pin 20).

The correct schematic would show a DPDT that routes the
two lines TXD and RXD of the CP2104 Friend, to one of
two possible destinations: either of the two (shown)
C8051F330D USART ports (on pins 19 and 20).

The F330D with the C2 lines connected is the application
MCU to be initialized; the one without (C2D and C2CK
connected at pins 17 and 18 -- or 18 and 17, swapped)
also needs the CP2104 Friend connection at its UART
(Pins 19 and 20).

In other words, the Application MCU only gets a UART
connection on the four pins 17, 18, 19 and 20 .. there
is never anything connected to the Application MCU at
pins 17 and 18 - only on pins 19 and 20.

Whereas, the JTAG/C2 MCU has four connections all ganged
together, at pins 17, 18, 19 and 20.

The two wires at pins 17 and 18 are the ones that are
routed to the Application MCU for C2D and C2CK.


  --

AppMCU P2.0 - package pin 8 - C2D  (C2 protocol, data line).
routed to:
JTAG/C2_MCU P0.6 - package pin 18 - used here as C2D (defined by the JTAG/C2 program).

AppMCU /RST - package pin 7 - C2CK (C2 protocol, clock line).
routed to:
JTAG/C2_MCU P0.7 - package pin 17 - used here as C2CK (defined by JTAG/C2 program).


AppMCU P0.4 - package pin 20 - TX? UART
routed to:
CP2104 Friend - RXD

AppMCU P0.5 - package pin 19 - RX? UART
routed to:
CP2104 Friend - TXT

These two (AppMCU P0.4, P0.5) only get the connection to
the CP2104 Friend after (normal user application) software
has been uploaded to the target.

Otherwise, the JTAG/C2_MCU gets the same connection from
the CP2104 Friend.  Never both MCU's at the same time.

This policy was enforced using two separate jacks on the
carrier board, that routed RS232 serial (via MAX3232) to
just one of the two MCU's at a time.

Here, the suggestion is DPDT - either a real one, or just
move the pair of wires from one MCU to the other, as the
roles require.

The JTAG/C2_MCU gets its UART connection whenever the
'c2' interface is used (download, erase, dump).

The two C2 protocol wired can stay bonded between the
two MCU's at all times - no need to remove them when
they are not put to use.

END.
