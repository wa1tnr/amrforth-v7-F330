  System was rolled back to Gforth 0.6.x to be able to download
  directly to the C8051F330D DIP-20 MCU, using CP2104 (Adafruit's
  PiUART, repurposed with no modifications to it other than
  cutting the one usual trace to prevent +5VDC from propagating).

  System runs fine on recent Gforth (0.7.x) -- no changes to the
  amrforth system were required.  However, no combination of efforts
  produced a functioning serial download (TX/RX, CP2104 interface).

  Puzzling since C2 works fine with the same hardware; once C2 is
  leverage for a download, the regular forth environment communicates
  with the target, just as expected!

  Download handshaking seemed to be at issue.

  Gforth 0.6.x proves the hardware is fine as-is; something about
  gforth itself may be at issue.


  RESET

  The reset line of the C8051F330D target is shared with C2CLK.

  When a reset line and system (pullup, capacitor) is used on
  the pin for ordinary serial bootloading/downloading, it has
  to be removed from the line when it is used as C2CLK.
