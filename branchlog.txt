INTENT is to rapidly commit good changes to dvlp-bb,
and immediately merge them back into dvlp-aa, and
(possibly) never use dvlp-xx as source of any merge.

This way, tested changes are merged into dvlp-aa (a
public-facing branch) only.

dvlp-xx was where the work was done, but a brief
inspection suggests it wasn't used (at all) and
its presence seems unimpactful (Sun 17 Apr 11:11z).
