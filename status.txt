Recently added F330 template directory.

Fairly straightforward to make operational.  If in doubt,
only be sure gforth is v6, and start with the upstream
version (part of this repository holds that).

If gforth v6 for any reason does not serve, also try v5.
Gforth V7 is pretty much off limits (feel free to try though).

A few files are linked and may be broken as-is (fix the links!
or just copy the real files they stand for into where the
linked files are).

Some of the most recent work has the operator press and hold
the RESET button on the target system, initiate download,
then let go of the RESET button - no space bar interim step.

Sometimes this is the best way.

end.
