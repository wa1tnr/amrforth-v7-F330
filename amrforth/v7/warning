If you have purchased the amrGadget developer's system, you have four
printed circuit boards.  The largest is called the motherboard.  The
next smaller board is the f017 target board.  The remaining two smaller
boards are the f300 target board and the JTAG interface board.

Most of the time you will be developing code for one or the other of the
target boards.  You should not install both at the same time.  This will
not work.  Decide whether you are developing for the f017 chip or for
the f300 chip, then install the appropriate board as follows:

Hold the motherboard such that the two black modular connectors are in
the lower right corner.  If you are using the f017 board, install it in
the left most IDE connector, with the parts side facing you and the
modular connectors.  If you want to use the f300 target board, install
it into the middle IDE connector, once again with the parts side facing
you and the modular connectors.  These two configurations will satisfy
most of your programming needs.

If you find that you need to use the JTAG interface board, it is
installed in the right most IDE connector, also with the parts side
facing you and the modular connectors.  In this case you must also
install either the f017 board or the f300 board, but not both of them.

We hope this will prevent confusion.
