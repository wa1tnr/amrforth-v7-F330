IMPORTANT

C2 commands in the ide work in any project directory.

Therefore you can use them to dump, erase and download
new firmware that is *not* C2 oriented at all.

Seems like the C2 firmware itself does not carry the
bootloader (its directory is labeled jtag).

So, to do serial booloading, use c2 to sequentially
dump, erase, dump and finally download (terminating
the session back to the Linux shell each iteration).

That will load your current project onto the target
MCU (F330D) even though it was found to be unresponsive
(its serial bootloader was inoperative).

This happens from time to time; c2 is the path back
to a resident bootloader.

There is no distinguishing the serial bootloader from
the rest of your application - both reside in the same
part of the memory map of the F330 (or it seems to be
that way, since 'blowing' the serial bootloader code is
easy to do).

It's possible to go weeks without needing the c2 protocol
at all, and simply use the serial bootloader.

On occasion that will cease to function.

It is unknown how else to recover from this (somewhat
rare) inoperative condition.

Flashing firmware via C2 seems to correct it, almost
always.

end.
