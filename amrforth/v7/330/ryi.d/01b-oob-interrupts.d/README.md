# morse.fs

### amrforth v7 - timed LED flashes

The program attempts to use the timers and the PCA
to send morse code - originally for a piezo buzzer.

It is an old amr app note, ported here to a more
functional demo of what it was meant to do.

Source came from v6_4 which has the note about Apop
under a ./lib directory.
