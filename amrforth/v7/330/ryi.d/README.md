# ryi.d
## series of tutorials c8051f330d specific

morse25 was revisited from the amr app note, in an effort to harness
basic awareness of interrupts on F330D.

With some effort it was fully adapted to current circumstances
in 2025 (mostly ignorance on how to use it unaltered, or very
slightly altered).

This should form the basis of an understanding to further grasp
the tutorials, most of which require use of interrupts. ;)
