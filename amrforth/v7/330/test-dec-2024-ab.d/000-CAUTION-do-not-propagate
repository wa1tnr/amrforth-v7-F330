CAUTION: DO NOT PROPAGATE  without detailed thought/plans

This directory is meant only for immediate testing; due to
the lack of frequent use of AMR Forth (lately) it seemed like
a good idea to work with a cheap snapshot, and give it a
unique branch name.

Nothing about this directory is meant to be long-term, in the
one sense of propagating it to other projects.

It's not for that (and is itself a copy of a somewhat known to
work well project).

And an incomplete copy at that: no effort made to supply the
forth source (for gforth running on the host Linux PC) for
the c2 routines, basic &c.

So please, look elsewhere for 'completeness' as it is not intended
to supply that in this directory (March 2024).
