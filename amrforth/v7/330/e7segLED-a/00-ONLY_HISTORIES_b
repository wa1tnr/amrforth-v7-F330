Basically, this (very) file marks the only copy of the
work done (and committed to a public repository) since
March of 2018 (as of 11:49z 17 Apr 2022).

Should compile and upload clean; may not be entirely
committed (but works in the local directory just fine).

Tested on new (April 2022) target board (on small
breadboard affixed to perfboard, with reset button
and CP2104 Friend).

Had to change com back to 1 (/dev/ttyUSB0) which
apparently isn't a committed change, in amrfconf.fs
which currently reads:

: processor  s" C8051F330" ;
: sfr-file  s" sfr-f330.fs" ;
: downloader  s" download-cygnal.fs" ;
9600 constant baudrate
create frequency 24500000 ,
250 constant default-TH1
true constant smod?
635 constant rom-start
create polled-kernel
1 value com?

$ ./gforth
decimal 635 hex . 27B  ok

bootloader330.fs:71:    $7b org  \ Code starts here, after interrupts (on both F310 F330).

The $7b (0x27b is 635 decimal) has been carefully checked,
this week, as have the others encountered (F310, F300).

END.
