 20.72 mA is I_Total for the breadboard, when displaying
 three digits but not every segment lit.  Message is
 bac and F82 or something like that (alternating).

 The current is max when no segments are lit!

 9.50 10.13

 MCU Vcc line is 9.50 mA unlit; 10.13 lit.  So there's a
 significant current draw not directly through the MCU,
 on the order of 10 mA (ULN2804A, PN2222A x 3, and a
 discrete LED that is always lit).

 MCU Vcc line 15.22 mA with all 8 segments lit incl DP on three digits (24 segments!)

 Delta is about 5 mA for entire digit.

 LabVolt x 2 different ammeters reports similar results. Nothing wrong with measurements.


 Suspicion: The voltage divider for the collector Q1 PN2222A is presently
 470 ohms (low side) 2200 ohms (high side to Vcc).  These were selected
 for performance of the circuit, but may not have the dynamic range
 required.

 Also, the 47k input to the base of Q1 may be too much (insufficient current
 flowing through the base).
 
 Specifically, the PN2222A's only partially turn on ULN2804A Darlingtons.  If memory
 serves, a different set of values was chosen initially, that did not fully
 turn off the inputs to the Darlingtons.  The newer values fully turn off
 the Darlingtons (by lowering the input closer to ground than the initial
 values did).

 Note: MPS2222A or similar part number is the correct callout for this device.

 It was noted that the other three digits (all 8's - every segment lit) grew
 more dim when the fourth digit was energized by applying Vcc 3.3 directly to
 its ULN2804A input (and it was brighter than the other three digits, even
 to their brightnesses prior to its being lit).

 That may possibly (unsure) be explained by the simple fact that all four digits
 share what amounts to eight power busses -- each A or B or C .. segment .. is
 wired in parallel with the other three (from the other three digits).

 Adding the fourth member of that grouping creates another branch current.

 Each segment puts a bit less than 1 mA onto its port pin on the F330D, as
 it sources current (provides some positive voltage <= 3.3VDC).

 I_total thru the MCU, with all 64 segments lit, was 16 mA (max 8 mA added
 split between 8 segment sourcing port pins of the F330D).  Again, about 1 mA
 per segment /bus/.  The 16 mA measurement was taken both with the ULN2804A
 cathode driver inputs connected direct to Vcc 3.3 (at the rail) and with
 each of their inputs connected to a port pin (directly, and through a
 current-limiting resistor -- I_Total thru the rail was about the same in
 each case).

 The only way I_Total can be further increased is to lower the current-limiting
 resistances on each of the 8 segment bus driving pins of the F330D MCU.

 The suspicion about PN2222A having a lack of dynamic range seems unfounded,
 at this juncture.


 09 Mar 22:14z:

 The colon dots are now connected to P0.2, which raises baseline from 9.7 mA
 through the F330 MCU, to 11.7 mA (delta 2 mA for the two segments of the
 colon dots pair).

 This is nice because they only go off when /RST is brought low, or by
 program control.  This is deep in the kernel, so it would have to be
 changed there, if desired.

 startup is currently setup to turn off P0.2:

 Absolute Max is 500 mA and 100 mA (500 mA through VDD or GND;
 100 mA *sunk* though any port pin (current sourced will be
 less than this).

 Consult Table 14.1 Port I/O DC Electrical Characteristics.

     VDD is 2.7 to 3.6 VDC.

     I_OH  -10 mA (push-pull) -- VDD - 0.8V typical.

     I_OL  8.5 mA (max 0.6V)
     I_OL  25 mA (1.0 Volt typical)

  
 So, sink to 25 mA or source to 10 mA (push-pull).  Power
 supply is 3.301 volts on the nose.

 2.7 VDC after 470 ohm current-limiting resistor off of each port pin.

 3.12 VDC on the port pin itself. 


 If you divide absolute max by 4, you get the specified 25 mA
 sunk by the port pins.  Extrapolating from that, a 125 mA
 limit through VDD or GND might be reasonable as a working
 figure (within Port I/O DC Electrical Characteristics).



 10 mA sourcing current x 17 port I/O pins is 170 mA which is
 beyond spec (taking 125 mA to be that spec, here).

 8 mA x 17 is 136 mA so plan for 7 mA or less, maybe.  5 mA per
 port pin would be better (and would be plenty bright).

 9.57/12.24 mA for no/two segments lit, with new 220 ohm current
 limiting resistors inline with the port pins.
