Tests indicate that a combination of actions produces a
new, functioning JTAG/C2 MCU from an old one.

  An MCU that had a smaller program was reprogrammed
  via C2 of the contents of this directory (the JTAG/C2
  interface program).

  Then the two MCUs were swapped.

  The newly-minted JTAG/C2 unit seemed to do its job.

  The older JTAG/C2 unit, now in the role of just an
  application target, would not download via serial.
  Changing its programming required C2 (which worked
  fine).

  Once it was reprogrammed with the contents of ../example
  it was then able to redownload ia serial (CP2104
  PiUART interface).

It would seem that the JTAG/C2 program itself was not
a good platform for downloading updates to its own
code, at least not during these tests.

Instead, a functioning JTAG/C2 programmed MCU is used
to update another MCU, via C2 only, in some cases (as
when it happens to be holding a program that does not
have a good serial bootloader).

Not certain it is possible to start from scratch, with
just a pair of (uninitialized) factory MCUs.  Would
probably require a working debugger of some sort, that
can talk C2 and upload a binary.
