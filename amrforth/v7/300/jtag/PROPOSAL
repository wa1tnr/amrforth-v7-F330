  * Turnkey this Jtag/c2 code and upload to F300 on regular serial bootloader and port.

    RESULT: works after USB0 used.

  * cd to F300 example and 'ruin' the JTAG.  Test that and come back here. 12:58z

    F300 example 4a2d7c14e6de401d0a426e 19 April - test this.

    RESULT: amrforth-v7-F330/amrforth/v7/300/example  fully tested - definitely 'ruined'
            the old JTAG program on this target board (which means in order to use C2
            again, it'll need to be reprogrammed from code found in
            amrforth-v7-F330/amrforth/v7/300/jtag  in order to meet this PROPOSAL. ;) 21 April 2022

  * cd to F300 jtag and reinstall JTAG/C2 program on F300.

    REMEMBER: it's just a turnkey and an ordinary serial bootloader download of JTAG/C2 code.

    Not using an F330 to do a C2 upload to this F300 board. ;)

            RESULT: new turnkey F300 now under test 13:58z 21 April 2022.


  * cd to F330 and 'ruin' the good e7seg prog, then reinstate it, both using C2. 21 Apr 14:02z

     cd ./amrforth-v7-F330/amrforth/v7/330/e7segLED-a  21 Apr 14:03z 2022

     RESULT: F330 'ruined' with a simpler program that operated the 7-segment 4-digit LED
             display just fine.  C2 seems just fine using F300 JTAG/C2.  Considered vetted now.
