-- Move v6.4 to this directory.  Started a text based user interface,
run by the shell command ./amrf.  Started a configuration program.
Downloaders for Cygnal and ADuC.  Makefile for use in Linux and with
VIM.  Script for downloading from the shell, d.

Fri Oct 15 16:35:57 PDT 2004 zip012
-- Factored and streamlined the config.fs program.  Not finished.

Mon Oct 18 12:07:06 PDT 2004 zip013
-- Finished with config.fs for now.

Wed Oct 20 13:16:14 PDT 2004 zip014
-- In process of converting 8051 disassembler to work in v7.

Wed Oct 20 17:50:44 PDT 2004 zip015
-- Much more of the disassembler finished.  Added byte dump, colors,
labels.  Need to get all the byte dumps right (1, 2, or 3 bytes) and
handle inline literals such as lit and (s").

Thu Oct 21 15:02:15 PDT 2004 zip016
-- Changed definition of 2+ from high level to code.  Added display of
inline literals and ; for tail recursed jumps to the
decompiler/disassembler.

Thu Oct 21 15:51:40 PDT 2004 zip017
-- Made a change in metacomp.fs which fixed the spacing for calls and
jumps without labels in the decompiler/disassembler.

Thu Oct 21 16:03:50 PDT 2004 zip018
-- More minor spacing changes.

Fri Oct 22 17:19:28 PDT 2004 zip019
-- Improved the decompiler/disassembler.  Now you can type see <word>
from the main screen and the disassembler is loaded and run on <word>.
Finished the byte dump words for each instruction.  Coded >get in
interpret.fs in preparation for the single-stepper.  Centralized the
colorscheme into a single file.  It had been redundantly spread out.

Mon Oct 25 14:48:08 PDT 2004 zip020
-- Separated the screen background and scroll window commands out and
centralized them in system.fs.  The individual modules can now be run
separately in a normal shell window such that the shells history
function is not defeated.

Mon Oct 25 15:54:53 PDT 2004 zip021
-- In the decompiler/disassembler now the SFRs are displayed by name,
not just by address.

Mon Oct 25 16:15:54 PDT 2004 zip022
-- Made a new log file to mark addresses in tables compiled by , and c,
so that the disassembler/decompiler can avoid trying to disassemble
table entries.

Tue Oct 26 15:39:28 PDT 2004 zip023
-- First pass at the single stepper.  No special cases are handled yet,
only calls and tail recursive jumps.

Wed Oct 27 15:59:35 PDT 2004 zip024
-- Single stepping through branch (one of the jump instructions)
correctly.  Needed to make another log file to do it, namely
branches.log.  This is so that a branch can be distinguished from a tail
recursive jump, impossible otherwise I think.

Wed Oct 27 17:35:49 PDT 2004 zip025
-- Got the branch to look right when stepping through begin again.  The
timing had to be tweaked.  Also LIT works now.

Thu Oct 28 11:06:35 PDT 2004 zip026
-- Development is taking place in ./300/example.  I added a couple of
scripts there to check and see if the important files are identical in
each directory.  This is to be sure I have copied the new files into
this directory before saving the latest version.  The scripts are called
check and checkall.  Using them I found 2 files that hadn't been
synched.

Thu Oct 28 11:26:58 PDT 2004 zip027
-- Changed colorscheme, using bold text in disassembler makes yellow
look yellow instead of brown.  Replicated SEE in the inteprpreter as
well as in the main window.  More convenient for debugging.

Thu Oct 28 12:06:50 PDT 2004 zip028
-- Single stepper now handles ?BRANCH.

Thu Oct 28 15:22:23 PDT 2004 zip029
-- Single stepper now handles FOR,NEXT.  Return stack is not simulated,
the target return stack is used.  This means that words like r@ can run
on the target without simulation.

Thu Oct 28 16:28:26 PDT 2004 zip030
-- Single stepper now handles (STRING) for s".

Thu Oct 28 16:40:03 PDT 2004 zip031
-- Added the 'e' command to system.fs, which for now runs my favorite
editor, VIM.

Fri Oct 29 16:37:02 PDT 2004 zip032
-- Got nesting to work.  Started attempting to handle the hand optimized
code sequences in the single stepper.  Got the colors more centralized
it the file colorscheme.fs.  Still need to do same in system.fs.  Added
rdepth and .rs to the stock system because it is very useful in the
single stepper.

Mon Nov  1 16:24:45 PST 2004 zip033
-- Got the single stepper working with source display, similar to the
old F-PC and v5 single steppers.  Not finished, can't nest yet.  Also no
controlling the size of the source display yet.

Tue Nov  2 12:15:08 PST 2004 zip034
-- Working in getting the source display to scroll when it's too long
for the space allotted.  Added the instruction lines.

Tue Nov  2 13:59:37 PST 2004 zip035
-- Got the scrolling to look pretty good, including a stack dump right
under the source code display.  Still needs more testing.

Tue Nov  2 15:59:24 PST 2004 zip036
-- Apparently fixed bug in single stepper where EXIT (RET) would crash.
Needs more testing though.

Wed Nov  3 11:40:26 PST 2004 zip037
-- Fixed the EXIT bug even better.  Now the ; gets properly highlighted
while waiting to be executed, when the RET instruction has been
compiled.  Added refresh-display, in case the display ever gets messed.

Wed Nov  3 14:03:29 PST 2004 zip038
-- Cosmetic changes to do-forth in the single stepper.

Wed Nov  3 14:44:13 PST 2004 zip039
-- Got the first code optimization to single step, namely 1-dup0=until.

Wed Nov  3 16:34:02 PST 2004 zip040
-- Got most of the optimizations working in the single stepper.  Still
to do: dup>r, r>drop, #and, #or, #xor, #lit.

Thu Nov  4 10:26:13 PST 2004 zip041
-- Added dup>r and r>drop to the list of optimizations that can be
single stepped.

Thu Nov  4 10:58:18 PST 2004 zip042
-- Added #and, #or, #xor, and #lit to the list of optimizations that can
be single stepped.

Thu Nov  4 11:41:11 PST 2004 zip043
-- Renamed dup0=if and dup0=until to dupnotif and dupnotuntil.  They
seem more consistent now with dup0<notif and dup0<notuntil.

Thu Nov  4 16:01:23 PST 2004 zip044
-- Exec: is handled in the single stepper.  There is still a bug when
nesting into a word containing exec:, need to solve that tomorrow.

Fri Nov  5 11:14:55 PST 2004 zip045
-- Still can't nest into a create,does> word in the single stepper.
Make immediate words for #and, #or, #xor, and #lit to be used in high
level forth.  They reclaim the preceeding literal and assemble the
appropriate optimized code.

Fri Nov  5 14:05:52 PST 2004 zip046
-- Source code display is correct for DOES> type words, even nesting,
except in the case of the beginning of the word, the DOES> code segment.
The single stepper handles the code correctly, just doesn't display the
source quite right.

Mon Nov  8 13:03:32 PST 2004 zip047
-- Still unable to get the highlighting correct on the word DOES>, but
the source _is_ displayed and all the other words are highlighted
correctly.

Thu Nov 11 14:20:12 PST 2004 zip048
-- Got serial ports working for Gforth in Windows today.  Used calls to
the file cygwin1.dll using the new fflib.fs for Gforth 0.6.2.  Still a
few problems.  The file gforth.fi can't be found when I call gforth from
gforth, unless it is copied into the local directory.  The bottom line
of the display isn't used properly in Windows yet.  Otherwise, pretty
good!

Tue Nov 16 15:45:29 PST 2004 zip049
-- The display is pretty much the same now in Windows and Linux.  Row
numbers seem to be off by one in Windows vs. Linux for the ansi display.

Thu Nov 18 15:17:26 PST 2004 zip050
-- Removed words to create stepper-source-file, which was only needed by
Tcl/Tk.  Noticed problems with single-stepper.

Thu Nov 18 15:37:45 PST 2004 zip051
-- The single-stepper problem was the wrong mask for absolute addresses.
Fixed.

Thu Nov 18 16:00:32 PST 2004 zip052
-- Cleaned up kernel8051.fs, removing commented out lines.  Also removed
some unneeded files.

Fri Nov 19 12:00:54 PST 2004 zip053
-- Fixed a bug in singlestepper where C for continuous would crash at
the end of a word.

Fri Nov 19 14:38:51 PST 2004 zip054
-- Added the special word 'timing' to the intepreter, which toggles the
timing display variable.

Fri Nov 19 16:52:57 PST 2004 zip055
-- Started restoring BASIC to v7.  The compiler from v6 still works, but
the interpreter needs to be recoded in forth.

Mon Nov 22 12:48:57 PST 2004 zip056
-- Changed BASIC interpreter so that hostbasic is a vocabulary rather
than a series of comparisons.  Much simpler and more compact.

Mon Nov 22 13:53:59 PST 2004 zip057
-- Got infix to at least partially work in basicinterpreter.fs.

Mon Nov 22 16:59:28 PST 2004 zip058
-- Filled out the basic interpreter to include LET, PRINT, GOSUB, PAUSE,
WAIT, HIGH, and LOW.  PAUSE is too slow.

Tue Nov 23 16:06:40 PST 2004 zip059
-- Fixed disassembler to show SFR name for PUSH and POP.  Changed the
top and bottom line displays.  They are more standardized and factored
better.

Tue Nov 23 17:18:30 PST 2004 zip060
-- c2.fs has some real words in it now, though untested.

Mon Nov 29 16:43:25 PST 2004 zip061
-- c2.fs has been fleshed out and tested.  Noticed that the jtag code
has not yet been converted to subroutine-threaded, won't compile.  We've
been using the v5 compilation.

Mon Nov 29 18:10:05 PST 2004 zip062
-- Jtag.fs has been fleshed out too and mostly tested.  The code common
to each (C2 and JTAG) has been separated into the file jtag_c2.fs to
avoid redundancy or missed changes.

Wed Dec  1 13:21:25 PST 2004 zip063
-- Changed bootf300.fs, bootf017.fs, and bootf061.fs.  Renamed COLD to
RESET to avoid the not unique message.  Also RESET makes more sense.

Thu Dec  2 14:01:28 PST 2004 zip064
-- Moved and tested the converted JTAG file for 300 from v6.4.  Deleted
some unneeded files from past versions.  Still need to go through
'release' and 'prepinstall'.

Thu Dec  2 17:25:26 PST 2004 zip065
-- Added 'help local' and 'help online' to run a browser for help.
Tested in Linux with konqueror so far, not in Windows yet.

Thu Dec  2 17:50:15 PST 2004 zip066
-- Worked on the 'prepinstall' script for releasing a new version.
Still needs testing.

Fri Dec  3 14:36:33 PST 2004 zip067
-- Gforth in Windows has a path problem where it can't find gforth.fi
sometimes.  The cure seems to be to put gforth.fi in the current
directory.  'amr.bat' now copies gforth.fi into the current directory
before running gforth.  Not very satisfying but it works.

Fri Dec  3 17:51:58 PST 2004 zip068
-- Updated the readme files in the amrForth home directory to refer to
v7 instead of v6.  Added an 'e' command back into the file 'system.fs',
which runs vim by default.

Mon Dec  6 17:54:43 PST 2004 zip069
-- Added the following batch files: c.bat, turnkey.bat, d.bat, f.bat,
b.bat, see.bat, c2.bat, and jtag,bat.  This is for Windows 2000 users
and maybe XP too.  Gforth can't seem to call another gforth in Windows
2000.

Mon Dec  6 18:46:24 PST 2004 zip070
-- Fixed batch files: config.bat and project.bat.

Wed Dec  8 18:55:09 PST 2004 zip071
-- In the process of adding support for 8051, 8052, 80c451, 80c552, and
80c537.  Downloader not working yet.

Thu Dec  9 14:05:52 PST 2004 zip072
-- Made changes in serial-linux.fs and serial-windows.fs to allow use of
the old amr boards at 19200 baud.

Thu Dec  9 14:37:32 PST 2004 zip073
-- Made changes in end8051.fs and download-oldamr.fs, to allow
downloading to and then cold starting our old boards.

Thu Dec  9 15:08:31 PST 2004 zip074
-- Fixed the project.bat file so it correctly checks for the existence
of the project directory.

Fri Dec 10 13:42:00 PST 2004 zip075
-- Fixed end8051.fs so that it still works with the new system, not just
the old one!

Fri Dec 10 14:12:50 PST 2004 zip076
-- Updated readme.windows to help people using Windows 2000 figure out
how to use amrForth.  A problem in gforth in Windows 2000 prevents the
main host user interface from working, so Windows 2000 users must work
from the command prompt instead.

Mon Dec 13 18:58:52 PST 2004 zip077
-- Fixed a bug in the word 'string' in the file 'config.fs' which caused
a control character to appear in the file 'amrfconf.fs'.

Tue Dec 14 18:27:00 PST 2004 zip078
-- Supporting the Atmel AT89C51RC2 including 'download-atmel.fs'.  This
is mainly for the prototype webGadget.

Wed Dec 15 14:27:03 PST 2004 zip079
-- In response to Wolfgang Allinger's concerns, the operators /mod, /,
mod, and */ have been made optional.  Edit the file 'compile.fs' to
choose from three versions, unsigned, symmetric, and floored.  The
signed operators still need testing.

Wed Dec 15 17:57:11 PST 2004 zip080
-- Now words with embedded double quotes can be used without confusing
the disassembler, singlestepper, or interpreter.  Also the optimized
words dupnotif and dupnotuntil have aliases dup0=if and dup0=until.
Added 'forth.vim' for those who use vim as their editor.

Tue Dec 21 13:59:25 PST 2004 zip081
-- Fixed bug in iramLOG in 'kernel8051.fs' which showed incorrect
addresses.  Bug noticed and fixed by Wolfgang Allinger.  Thanks.

Wed Jan  5 10:52:54 PST 2005 zip082 v7.0.1 beta
-- Fixed spelling of http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/gforth/ in
both readme.windows and readme.linux.  Now maybe people can find gforth.
Thanks to Henrik Thurfjell for pointing this out.

Fri Jan  7 14:38:15 PST 2005 zip083
-- Fixed some bugs pointed out by Ed of Australia.  The file config.fs
refered to the files 'sfr-51.fs' and 'sfr-52.fs'.  Changed to
'sfr-31.fs' and 'sfr-32.fs', since those are the names of the actual
files.  Also the file 'compile.fs' sets the fpath to a v6 directory.
Rather than change this to v7 I removed it as we no longer have any need
to know where the installation directory is.  Any file that is needed is
copied into the project directory.  Also, the file 8051.bin was an old
kernel/loader rom for 8051/80c451 chips, those with only 128 bytes of
internal RAM.  It was set up for 9600 baud, should be 19200 baud.  The
new file, 80c451.bin is set up for 19200 baud.  It should work for any
8051 that has only 128 bytes of RAM.
   Added the definition  : t  turnkey ;  to system.fs.  I got tired of
typing the whole word over and over.

Fri Jan  7 15:22:32 PST 2005 zip084 v7.0.2_beta
-- Freshened all the example directories, bumped the name, ran
prepinstall to create a release.

Thu Jan 13 12:06:05 PST 2005 zip085
-- Made a conditionally compiled word gforth-string which is used to
call gforth from gforth.  Different in Windows than in Linux.  Also did
same for amr.bat, as suggested by Bob Nash from his experience with
Windows 2000.

Thu Jan 13 14:17:15 PST 2005 zip086
-- Tested those changes in Windows 98, and they don't work!  Don't know
why.  Since I don't have 2000 or XP to test on, I will leave this for a
later time, and go back to what works for 98.

Fri Mar 18 11:24:38 PST 2005 zip087
-- Added basicinterpreter.fs to freshen-project, in case anyone wants to
use amrBASIC.  Also added bash scripts compile, download, interpret, for
people who want to work from the bash command line in Linux.  Fixed bugs
in mathfloored.fs and mathsymmetric.fs, namely an incorrect ?negate.

Fri Mar 18 12:45:01 PST 2005 zip088
-- Experimenting with a suggestion from Wolfgang Allinger, namely to
include the bootloader with each compiled program.  This would eliminate
the need for a separate bootloader image and a separate bootloader
directory.  A bootloader can be compiled and installed via JTAG from any
directory.  Also the initialization code exists in every project
directory, not just the bootloader directory.  The only thing to be
careful about is assuming that the bootloader in the chip is the same as
the one you just compiled, since it is only downloaded via JTAG.  Thanks
Wolfgang, I wish I had thought of this in the first place.  (Charley).
So far implemented only in /amrforth/v7/300/example for testing.

Fri Mar 18 15:31:28 PST 2005 zip089
-- Extending ubiquitous bootloader into the 310.  Had to change 300/jtag
program to eliminate single use of /mod as well as headers for / and
mod, since they are not included by default anymore.

Fri Mar 25 15:25:31 PST 2005 zip090
-- Extended the ubiquitous bootloader into the 017.  Also started a lib
directory and included one file so far, adc310.fs.

Fri Mar 25 15:44:47 PST 2005 zip091
-- Extended bootloader into 061.  Haven't deleted the ~.../boot
directories yet.

Fri Mar 25 16:22:04 PST 2005 zip092
-- Deleted the ~.../boot directories.  Added a line to prepinstall for
changing the 061/example directory to DOS format.  Commented out the
lines doing same to the boot directories.  Now each of the Silicon
Laboratories (Cygnal) chips has its bootloader compiled along with it
always.  There is no longer a special bootloader file.  Any rom.hex will
act as a bootloader file if installed via JTAG.  Thanks again Wolfgang.

Mon Apr  4 11:32:56 PDT 2005 zip093
-- Added some filenames to "project.bat" so that it works just like the
Linux version.

Tue Apr 12 14:03:32 PDT 2005 zip094
-- Made 'download-aduc.fs' work with both Linux and Windows, as the rest
of the downloaders already did.

Wed May  4 13:04:45 PDT 2005 zip095
-- Added more .bat files to project.bat, so that users of NT, win2000,
XP, etc., can use the individual batch files when amr.bat fails.
Something about the NT branch of windows prevents Gforth from calling
another instance of Gforth.

Wed May  4 13:28:36 PDT 2005 zip096
-- Renamed see.bat show.bat, because I always have a script named see in
my project directories that shows my zip directory for that project.
Now type 'show <word>' instead of 'see <word>' for disassembly and
decompilation.

Wed May  4 14:30:28 PDT 2005 zip097
-- Cleaned up the scroll-window for single stepper.  It works properly
both from amr and from f.  Needs to be tested in windows too.  All this
is to make amrForth work in NT, win2000, and probably XP.

Fri May  6 11:01:06 PDT 2005 zip098
-- Added one more unix script (bash actually), called 'go'.  It attempts
to Compile, Download, and interpret Forth, in a single command.  If the
compile or the download fails, then no further commands are tried.  This
is run from the shell, not from 'amr'.

Mon May  9 12:04:56 PDT 2005 zip099
-- Renamed version to v7.1.0_beta in system.fs.  Making a new release
for the website.
